## Usage

Iron Money was designed to model a real product / service. During sign-up, you will be guided through the initial setup process, which includes creating specific targets for individual budget categories, and adding your very first expense item. The hub view (pictured above) will reflect your progress towards your goals, and updates in real time.

## Lessons Learned

Iron Money was my capstone project for Ironhack's Web Development program. During the planning and roadmapping phase, I set out to incorporate as many learned skills as possible into a singular final project. Working within a deadline timeframe, I prioritized the balance between added features, the end-user experience, and delivering a complete product. I believe this app represents that balance.
